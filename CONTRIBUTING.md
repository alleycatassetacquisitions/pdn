### Introduction

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Portable Data Node (PDN)** projects. Alleycat Asset Acquisitions (AAA) is excited to involve passionate community members in helping build an immersive, high-octane gaming experience, particularly with the technological integration of the PDNs into LARP events like Neotropolis. Whether you're here to suggest new content, help with development, or contribute ideas for our Cyberpunk LARP universe, this guide will help you understand how to contribute effectively.

### How You Can Contribute

1. **Code Contributions**: Help improve the PDN software by contributing to the firmware, creating new features, optimizing the codebase, or squashing bugs.
2. **Hardware Enhancements**: Suggest and implement new hardware integrations that can expand the capabilities of the PDN devices.
3. **Firmware Updates & Testing**: Assist in testing and debugging the PDN firmware on ESP32/ESP8266 platforms and help develop user-friendly update processes.
4. **Documentation**: Help expand and improve the project’s documentation, making it easier for new contributors to get started and users to manage their PDNs.
5. **Feature Suggestions & Bug Reports**: Provide feedback and ideas for enhancing the PDN’s functionality in the game, or report any bugs you encounter.
6. **Game Mechanics & Rules Development**: Propose new gameplay mechanics that can be integrated into the PDN software, ensuring that they are balanced and enhance the player experience.

### Getting Started

Before contributing, please ensure that you follow these steps:

1. **Familiarize Yourself with the Project**: Review the codebase in the repository and the project’s documentation (including this file, the `README.md`, and any relevant `wiki` pages). Understanding how the PDN firmware works will help you contribute more effectively.
   
2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**: Follow the instructions in the `README.md` to set up PlatformIO and any necessary dependencies on your local machine. Ensure you can build and flash the firmware onto an ESP32/ESP8266 device.

3. **Join Our Community**: [Join us on Discord!](https://discord.gg/6XGTCbKkUy)

### Contribution Workflow

1. **Propose Your Contribution**: Submit a brief outline of your contribution idea or feature request via GitHub issues.

2. **Develop Locally**: Set up your development environment using PlatformIO (see the `README.md` for details) and develop your feature or bug fix locally. Be sure to follow coding standards and best practices outlined in the project.

3. **Test Your Changes**: Test your changes thoroughly by flashing the firmware to a compatible microcontroller (ESP32-s3) and ensuring it works as intended in the game environment. Make use of the test files in the `test/` folder.

4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once your contribution is ready, commit your changes and push them to your fork. Open a pull request (PR) on the main repository for review. Provide a clear description of the changes made and link to any related issues.

5. **Code Review & Feedback**: A maintainer will review your PR and may provide feedback or request changes. Be open to collaborating and making any necessary adjustments to ensure your contribution aligns with the project’s standards.

6. **Approval & Integration**: Once your changes are approved, they will be merged into the main branch and may be included in a future release.

### Standards & Requirements

- **Originality**: All contributions must be original and not violate any copyright laws. Do not submit plagiarized content.
   
- **Coding Guidelines**: Follow the coding standards in the repository. Use meaningful variable names, document your code where appropriate, and ensure your changes do not introduce unnecessary complexity.
   
- **Testing**: Any code contributions should be accompanied by tests to ensure functionality. Use the files in the `test/` folder as a guide for writing new test cases.
   
- **Collaboration**: Be respectful and open to feedback when collaborating with other contributors. We are all working toward the same goal of improving the PDN experience.

### Bug Reporting

If you encounter any issues with the PDN software, here’s how you can report bugs effectively:

- Provide a clear and detailed description of the bug, including the firmware version and any hardware details.
- Include steps to reproduce the issue and any logs from PlatformIO or other relevant sources.
- Attach any relevant screenshots or video clips, if applicable.
- Suggest possible solutions or workarounds, if you have any ideas.

### Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to the following standards:

- **Be Respectful**: Treat others with kindness and professionalism.
- **Constructive Feedback**: When providing feedback, aim to be constructive and helpful.
